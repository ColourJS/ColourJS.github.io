    <h3>Ishaan Mishra</h3>
    <p>I'm a second year Computer Science &amp; Software Engineering [Co-op] student at the University of Windsor Ontario. 
    <br>
    Over the short term, I will get a co-op job for the summer to gain experience relevant to my field, work on the many ideas I have, continue learning about the various technologies out there, and self-improve by reading and practicing some good books. 
    <br>
    Over the long term, my passion lies in making software, mobile &amp; web applications, and turning my creations into businesses that will fulfill our societies' ever evolving needs. Alfred North Whitehead was completely right when he said "civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them." And that is exactly what I want to do with my work. I plan on achieving this through my deep desire for life-time learning because I think that is the best way for me to maximize my potential and my ability to create extraordinary value. It takes the same effort to have a small dream as it does to have a big dream, so I like to dream big!

      <h3>Jose Alba</h3>
    <p>I am beginning my third year in honours Computer Science at the University of Windsor, and I am concentrating in artificial intelligence, while excelling in my experimental learning opportunities. I have received multiple honours awards for computer science coursework and continuing to maintain an outstanding GPA. I have experience in Java, as well as a large number of programming languages.<br>
I am extremely passionate about computer science, and truly love my program. I’m an extremely hardworking student, who always puts his full effort, which should be reflected by my average. Computer science gives me great satisfaction because it allows me to create incredible innovations, which could positively impact the world. Some enter computer science for the money, but I truly want to make a difference. That is why I am entering the incredibly innovative field of artificial intelligence.<br>
As a co-op student I hope to gain industry relevant work experience. I am driven and independent, and can work effectively in a group environment. I have superb customer relations skills, and can handle conflict effectively. I can multitask and effectively prioritize to accomplish objectives with a positive attitude and strong work ethic. I’m open-minded to new learning experiences and would like the opportunity to gain industry-specific knowledge.</p>

      <h3>Amine Gherib</h3>
      <p>
      I'm a third year Computer Science student currently specializing in Software Engineering. I have held two 
      different research positions at the University of Windsor working for the Transportation Systems Innovation Laboratory
      of the Department of Civil Engineering. I developed and tested C++ programs to process data on all Windsor’s traffic which was used by transportation engineers to
      decide how to manage this infrastructure. I was also responsible for designing user-friendly interfaces for these programs.
      The summer after that, I worked at the Cross-Border Institute of the University of Windsor. I developed Geographical 
      Information Systems software using C# with the DotSpatial API and MapWindow
